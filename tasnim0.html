      <h4><b> Why did I choose to study CSE? </b></h4>
      <p>Well, The most important aspect of computer science is problem solving, an essential skill for life. Students study the design, development and analysis of software and hardware used to solve problems in a variety of business, scientific and social contexts., and so many other areas can be solved by computers. It can give me a lot of opportunities to work on any field I want.</p> <br>
